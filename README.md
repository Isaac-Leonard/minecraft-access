# Minecraft Access

Minecraft Access is a replacement of the other accessibility [mods.](https://github.com/accessible-minecraft) Just like
the previous mods, this mod also supports screen readers for windows, but now it also supports additional screen readers
thanks to [tolk](https://github.com/ndarilek/tolk) library. Additionally, the mod also supports linux using
the [libspeechdwrapper](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/libspeechdwrapper).

*Note that you may have to enable the narrator from within minecraft, in the first sartup, the mod speaks "Initializing minecraft access" but does not speak anything else, then you'll have to use `control + b` to enable the narrator. And for fabric users, you will have to manually un-bound or re-bound the advancement key from l to something else as that is also used by the camera controls feature.*

# Setup

## Requirements

1. The mod works with both forge and fabric, so you need to install either one of those. For forge, you can
   follow [this](https://thebreakdown.xyz/how-to-download-install-forge-to-play-minecraft-mods/) guide and for fabric
   you can follow [this](https://thebreakdown.xyz/how-to-download-install-the-fabric-mod-loader/) guide.
2. We also need to install the [architectury api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-api) mod.
3. Windows specific:-
   In windows we need to install the [tolk](https://github.com/ndarilek/tolk) library. Here are the steps to install the
   library:-
    - Download the latest build
      zip - [here](https://github.com/ndarilek/tolk/releases/download/refs%2Fheads%2Fmaster/tolk.zip).
    - Extract the downloaded zip file anywhere you like, the Downloads folder should be fine.
    - Open the extracted folder and in that folder you'll find a folder called `x64` and another called `x86`.
    - Based on your operating system, `x64` for 64-bit OS and `x86` for 32-bit OS, copy all the files present in the
      folder and paste them into the minecraft root folder (the folder containing the mods folder).
      The default location is -
      `%appdata%\.minecraft`
4. Linux specific:-
   In linux we need to install the [libspeechdwrapper](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/libspeechdwrapper) as well
   as [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool) which is used for simulating the mouse actions.
   Although the mod overrides the library used for tts, minecraft still needs the `flite` library to be installed, so
   you can install it using your distro's package manager itself.
   For libspeechdwrapper, download the
   library - [here](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/libspeechdwrapper/raw/main/lib/libspeechdwrapper.so),
   and move it over to the minecraft folder.
   The default location is -
   `~/.minecraft`
   Follow the [installation instruction](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool#installation) in the description to
   install xdotool.

## Mod Installation

- Download the mod file according to the loader installed from
  the latest release page - [here](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access/releases).
- Move the downloaded jar file over to the mods folder.
  For windows the default location is - `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods`
  And for linux it is - `~/.minecraft/mods`

The mod can be configured in two ways: using the config menu or directly editing the config.json file.
The config menu can be opened via the `Open Config Menu` option in the Narrator/F4 Menu.
Currently, we do not have a command to open the config menu so don't disable the narrator menu or you won't be able to open the config menu.
As for the other method, the config.json file can be found in the `config/minecraft_access/` directory.
You can use notepad or any text editor to edit the file. You can also use online json editor like
[Json Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/), [Json Formatter](https://jsonformatter.org/json-editor)
or [Code Beautify Json Online Editor](https://jsonformatter.org/json-editor).
