### New Features

#### I18N Fallback Mechanism

A fallback mechanism is added to I18n in case it fails on unsupported languages, or text that not translated in time in supported languages.
If any I18N failed on your language, the mod will use the English version instead.
Set the game to your familiar language is recommended, even if it's not supported by this mod, since you can still be benefited from translatable game original text, such as name of blocks or creatures.
If you want to contribute to translating work, we manage the translation of this mod in [another GitHub repository](https://github.com/khanshoaib3/minecraft-access-i18n#minecraft-access-i18n), take a look.

### Feature Changes

* Now whenever you're looking at a block and entity, the mod will play a piano sound cue to indicate relative location between you and target. see: [Relative Position Sound Cue Feature Description](/doc/FEATURES.md#relative-position-sound-cue)
